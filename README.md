**Authors**: Jinchen Sun, Haoran Zheng*

**Article Link**: None (the url will be given after the paper is accepted.)

# Requirement
To run the code, you need the following dependencies:
* PyTorch >= 1.9.0
* PyTorch Geometry == 2.0.3
* rdkit == 2020.09.2

# Reimplement
The average performace of HDN-DDI can be calculated by `evaluate.ipynb` and the training code will be supplemented after the paper is accepted.
